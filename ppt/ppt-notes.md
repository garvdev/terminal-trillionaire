##### Agile approach

Software Development - Agile

User Stories
As a user, I want to view the latest market data, so that I can make informed trading decisions.
As a user, I want to view my portfolio, so that I can evaluate my current holdings.
As a user, I want to save my portfolio, so that I can return to the simulator at a later point in time.
As a user, I want to quickly execute trades, so that I can become filthy rich.

Client - me
As the client, I want to simulate realistic market movements, so that my users become addicted to the app.
I don't know if what I think I want is possible with the tools available.

Developer - also me
Preliminary research and experimentation - MVC, OOP, Anti-Patterns, Gems, Curses, Threads.
Design basic model (MVC). Design additional features.
Begin developing MVP.

Project Management - Kanban
Show Trello board and briefly explain lists and colour coding.

##### Key takeaways
Over-planning can be detrimental - waterfall approach.
Start with user stories in order of what's most critical to the application.
Implementation of following user stories can and will likely change throughout development.

Whiteboards are the greatest invention since sliced bread.
Shoutout to Jake from officeworks.

##### Future
Ruby Threads - Concurrency - Build GUI which can accept user input to interact with the Live Market Dashboard.
Improve model to simulate event-driven movements such as black swan events or earnings releases.
Implement derivatives like options and futures - complex derivative strategy visualisation e.g. covered calls, straddles, collars.
